2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_fpga_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_fpga_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_fpga_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_fpga_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch debayering/control_unit_instance/compute_enable_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin debayering/control_unit_instance/compute_enable_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch debayering/control_unit_instance/image_finished_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin debayering/control_unit_instance/image_finished_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch debayering/control_unit_instance/next_state_reg[0] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin debayering/control_unit_instance/next_state_reg[0]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#4 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch debayering/control_unit_instance/next_state_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin debayering/control_unit_instance/next_state_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#5 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch debayering/control_unit_instance/next_state_reg[2] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin debayering/control_unit_instance/next_state_reg[2]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#6 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch debayering/control_unit_instance/prev_state_reg[0] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin debayering/control_unit_instance/prev_state_reg[0]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#7 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch debayering/control_unit_instance/prev_state_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin debayering/control_unit_instance/prev_state_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#8 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch debayering/control_unit_instance/rd_en_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin debayering/control_unit_instance/rd_en_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#9 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch debayering/control_unit_instance/s2p_enable_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin debayering/control_unit_instance/s2p_enable_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#10 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch debayering/control_unit_instance/valid_out_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin debayering/control_unit_instance/valid_out_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#11 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch debayering/control_unit_instance/wr_en_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin debayering/control_unit_instance/wr_en_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 11 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
Related violations: <none>
